Creating Volume from a Dockerfile

STEPS :-

1. Log into your AWS and launch your EC2 instance (linux) and access it through putty

2. Create some empty files
=> touch file1 file2 file3

3. Create a Dockerfile
=> vi Dockerfile
   FROM ubuntu
   VOLUME ["/vol_name"]

4. Create an image and container from this Dockerfile
=> docker build -t image_name .
   docker run -it --name container1_name image_name /bin/bash

5. Now you are inside the container 1 so to check vol dir and then create three empty files in vol dir and then exit from container
=> ls
   cd vol_name
   touch filex filey filez 
   exit

6. Now share volume dir from container 1 to container 2
=> docker run -it --name container2_name -privileged=true --volumes-from container1_name image_name /bin/bash

7. Now check if volume dir is container2 or not
=> ls
   cd vol_name/
   ls
   exit

8. Now if you have created any file in container2 volume then it would be visible from container1 volume dir because these both containers are sharing this volume directory.
