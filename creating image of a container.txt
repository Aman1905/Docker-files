2. Create an EC2 instance and access it through putty or you can start your previously stopped instance.

3. Now install the docker in your machine
=> yum install docker -y

4. Start the docker service
=> service docker start

5. Now create a container you want to make an image
=> docker run -it --name --container_name image_name /bin/bash

6. Now move to any default directory or create your own and make some changes in the container
=> cd tmp/ (default dir)

7. Make any file there
=> touch file_name

8. Now exit from here
=> exit

9. Now if you want to see the changes you have done yet then
=> docker diff container_name

10. Now create an image of this container
=>  docker commit container_name image_name

Note :- container_name ===>  must be same of which you want to make an image
	image_name ===> any name you want to give to this new image
