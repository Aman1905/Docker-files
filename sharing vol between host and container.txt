Now we will see how we can share volumes between host and containers.

STEPS :-

1. Log into AWS EC2 instance and access it through putty

2. Check the working directory here
=> pwd
   ls

3. Now you will see some files are there in this dir if you wish you can create some of your own files too
=> touch amanfile

4. Now create a container and a volume dir inside that container and map that vol dir with ec2 instance vol dir (ec2-user)
=> docker run -it --name container_name -v /home/ec2-user:/vol_name --privileged=true image_name /bin/bash
   ls
   cd vol_name
   touch choprafile
   exit

5. Now go to your host machine vol dir (ec2-user) and check it
=> cd ec2-user
