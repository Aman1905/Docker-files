1. Login into AWS and access it through putty

2. sudo su

3. yum install docker -y

4. service docker start

5. docker run -it --name cont_name os_name /bin/bash

6. Now create some files inside the container and then create an image
=> touch f1 f2 f3
   docker commit cont_name image_name

7. Now create an account in docker hub and again came into your host machinne
=> docker login

8. Now give a tag to your image name (name by which you want to publish it to the docker hub)
=> docker tag image_name dockerID/new_image_name
   docker push dockerID/new_image_name

** dockerID >> your username while ceating your account in docker hub
   image_name >> name of your image or os which you have created in step 6
   new_image_name  >> name which you want to be published in docker hub

9. Now you can see this image in your hub.
   Again create another instance in another region and try to pull this from hub and then check for the files you have created in step 6

=> docker pull dockerID/new_image_name
   docker run -it --name container_name dockerID/new_image_name /bin/bash
